# SDP051 - RC Car Conversion to Web Wi-Fi Control

This is the project for for CSE - Senior Design 2025 at the University of Connecticut. The project proposes transforming an existing traditional RC car and converting it into a smart rc car that could be controlled over wifi using any device through a web page. The idea for Uconn's engineering Demo Day was to let any person have a chance to control the car for a limited amount of time, hence we created a queuing system to let multiple users connect while one one stayed in control of the car and eased the user's requirements to play with the car to as little as scanning a QR code.
